hello-world
===========

I'm doing the tutorial, so this is my hello-world repo

I am starting to really learn javascript for a job I applied for and realized that I was being a stupid fighting with multiple copies of files on my hard drive. I know better than to not use version history! I have just been hesitant to learn GitHub 'cause it's so techy like and I've not been an official techy person for a long time.
